Title

Commune Database of Cambodia (2011)

Description
 
The Commune Database is produced by the NCDD (National Committee for Subnational Democratic Development). This file contains excerpts of the Database, namely quantitative data about size in terms of land area and family/household indicators (rice land, electricity, latrines, domestic violence) for each commune in Cambodia as well as agricultural and livestock production. Data were provided to us in vector format by Save Cambodia's Wildlife's Atlas Working Group.

Accuracy

The Commune Database is comprised of self-reported data from each locality and has known inconsistencies in comparison to other sources, such as the census produced by the National Institute of Statistics.

Logical Consistency

There are no known issues with logical consistency.

Completeness

ODC does not provide access to the full Commune Database since it is not already publicly available and ODC's information from the database is incomplete.

Processes

Data were provided to Open Development Cambodia directly by Save Cambodia's Wildlife's 2013 Atlas Working Group in ESRI Shapefile format. Commune-level data were combined and exported in CSV format.
